## API Endpoint Mapping

### New Public Endpoints
```javascript
'public': {
    'get': {
        'position': 1,           // For fetchPosition(s)
        'fundingRates': 1,       // For fetchFundingRate
        'markPrices': 1,         // For fetchMarkPrice
        'openInterest': 1,       // For fetchOpenInterest
        'borrowLend/markets': 1, // For fetchBorrowRates
        'borrowLend/markets/history': 1, // For rate history
    }
}
```

### New Private Endpoints
```javascript
'private': {
    'get': {
        'history/funding': 1,    // For funding history
        'history/interest': 1,   // For interest history
        'history/pnl': 1,        // For PnL history
        'history/settlement': 1, // For settlements
        'capital/deposit/address': 1, // For deposit addresses
    },
    'post': {
        'borrowLend': 1,         // For borrow/repay
    }
}
```

### New Instruction Mappings
```javascript
'GET:position': 'positionQuery',
'GET:history/funding': 'fundingHistoryQueryAll',
'GET:history/interest': 'interestHistoryQueryAll',
'GET:history/pnl': 'pnlHistoryQueryAll',
'GET:capital/deposit/address': 'depositAddressQuery',
'POST:borrowLend': 'borrowLendExecute',
```

## Implementation Notes

### Futures Considerations
- Perpetual markets use different symbol format: `SOL_USDC:USDC`
- Mark price used for liquidations and PnL
- Funding rates apply only to perpetuals
- Position sizes can be negative (short)

### Margin/Lending Notes
- Collateral requirements vary by asset
- Interest accrues continuously
- Auto-liquidation if health factor drops
- Some assets may not be borrowable

### WebSocket Specifics
- Microsecond timestamps (not milliseconds)
- Different signature format than REST
- Automatic reconnection required
- 60s ping/pong heartbeat

## Known Issues & Blockers

### Resolved Issues
1. **TypeScript Type Mismatches**:
   - parseFundingRate expected string parameter but we pass Dict - wrapped with type check
   - FundingRateHistory type doesn't have 'amount' field - removed from return
   - Position, FundingRate types needed to be imported

2. **API Method Generation**:
   - Need to run `npm run emitAPITs` after adding new endpoints
   - Methods are generated from API definitions in describe()

3. **ESLint Warnings**:
   - Unused variables for future use commented out
   - No trailing spaces allowed

### Current Implementation Notes
1. **Futures Support**:
   - Position endpoint returns single position per symbol
   - Funding rates only apply to perpetual markets
   - Mark price used for liquidation calculations

2. **Borrow/Lend Features**:
   - Rates are returned as APR (annual percentage rate)
   - Period is hardcoded to 365 days in milliseconds
   - Utilization rate included in responses

3. **Deposit Addresses**:
   - Network parameter maps to blockchain field
   - Memo/tag support for chains that require it
   - Address validation performed

## Next Steps After Phase 3

1. Phase 4: Complete WebSocket implementation
2. Full stream parsing and handling
3. Real-time order and position updates
4. Advanced order types (strategies)
5. Performance optimizations
